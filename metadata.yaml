description: '"Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures is the central text of
  the Christian Science religion. It was written by Mary Baker Eddy, inspired by studies
  of the Bible she undertook in 1867 following a healing experience. Science and Health
  posits a wholly metaphysical view of Christianity in which sin, disease, and death
  are not of God, and are therefore not real. Further, it suggests that by striving
  toward a spiritual understanding of the world as God''s perfect creation, these
  "false beliefs" are shed from one''s experience" -- p. [4] of cover.'
